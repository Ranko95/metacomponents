# Schema based frontend framework
### This is very raw and naive implementation (PoC)
```
npm i
npm start
```
### Features:
- Pure JavaScript without dependencies
- Declarative component definition
- Everything in JavaScript - no need to switch between HTML, CSS and JS
- Component schema change detection
